                set.
            model_path: the path to load the model from. One of model_id or model_path or checkpoint_path must be
                set. Same structure as the HF-hosted `model_id` models: bundle with a config.json and weights.pth.
            checkpoint_path: the checkpoint directory to load from, if model_id or model_path is not
                set. It should contain a distributed checkpoint with a config.json file as well as model_and_optim
                folder.
            selector: an optional sequence of attribute names or list indices to select
                the sub-module that should be applied on the input images. Defaults to
                ["encoder"] to select only the transformer encoder.
            forward_kwargs: additional arguments to pass to forward pass besides the
                 MaskedOlmoEarthSample.
            random_initialization: whether to skip loading the checkpoint so the
                weights are randomly initialized. In this case, the checkpoint is only
                used to define the model architecture.
            embedding_size: optional embedding size to report via
                get_backbone_channels (if model_id is not set).
            autocast_dtype: which dtype to use for autocasting, or set None to disable.
